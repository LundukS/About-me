Lunduk Sherpa- 02 – Dr. Case


Current
I completed my undergraduate here at Northwest with a Mathematics degree. I just started my master’s degree in Applied Computer Science this semester. I am originally from Nepal and have been in the US for almost 5 years now. I do not have a firm background in web development and this will be my first web development class. After the completion of my bachelor’s degree, I got my interest in the field of data science.

Throughout my stay here in US, I have been in Missouri most of the time. I like playing soccer, not a big video games fan, and I like playing and listening to music.

Future
My purpose of taking Applied Computer Science is that, with the knowledge of Computer Science I will be able to present myself better when I go about applying for jobs in the field of data science. As a startup I want to work in a company as a data analyst and later on own data center in my home country.
